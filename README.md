## Recommend one (or several) articles about one (or several) completely random subject per day in order to expand your mind   


I just finished reading the book Range by David Epstein.  

I strongly encourage you to read it. But, here's a very quick summary:
- in most situations (wicked environments), you are better off having had many diverse experiences vs a few very similar ones (breadth vs depth, generalization vs specialization);
- you should try many things to learn about your interests and abilities before committing to a focused practice;
- your (atypical) background is not a liability, don't feel like you are behind.   

New research is telling people to be broader, to have more breadth in order to make more connections and be more innovative/creative/successful/empathetic.
So I decided to develop an app that would recommend one (or several) articles a day about one (or several) completely random subject. Reaching/reading outside one's comfort zone is primordial.   

The idea is clearly not extraordinary. But to form a habit, you have to make it (the behavior) insanely easy. If you are interested in receiving the email daily, please let me know so I can (try to) do that.   

Please let me know if you have any feedback!
